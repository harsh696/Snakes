# Reuirements For Project
  ## 1. System Requirements:
   __A. Hardware Requirements:__<br />
   * Project uses the visual code as a coding platform.
   * Visual Studio Code is a small download (< 200 MB).
   * has a disk footprint of < 500 MB.
   * VS Code is lightweight and should easily run on today's hardware.<br />
   
We recommend:

  * 1.6 GHz or faster processor.
  * 1 GB of RAM
  
  __B. Platforms:__<br />
  
   VS Code has been tested on the following platforms:
   * OS X El Capitan (10.11+)
   * Windows 7 (with .NET Framework 4.5.2), 8.0, 8.1 and 10 (32-bit and 64-bit)
   * Linux (Debian): Ubuntu Desktop 16.04, Debian 9.
   * Linux (Red Hat): Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 8, Fedora 24.

  ## 2. Softwere Requirements:

  * [__VS code__](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit, compile, build and debug your C code.
  * [__git__](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Source code management.
  * [__cppcheck__](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) for static code analysis.
  * __Doxygen extension in VS code__ for automatic generation of syntax.
  * [__Doxywizard__](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) for creating doxygen files.
  * [__Make__](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) for automating your builds on any OS.

  ## 3. Testing Requirements:
  
  * __UNIT TESTING__ is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.
  * The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. 
  * Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers.
  * Require __Make__ and __unity__ files to perform unit testing.
